**Wildfire Prediction Project Design Document**
1. Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning pipeline that predicts the burned areas from wildfires in various regions of Africa, based on historical wildfire data. This is crucial for wildfire management and environmental protection. Wildfires pose serious environmental, social, and economic challenges. The dataset used includes various climate features, land cover data, and elevation measurements. The key objective of this project is to develop an accurate predictive model to forecast wildfire occurrences and intensities, allowing better allocation of resources and proactive management.
2. Problem Definition

This project is based on Zindi’s Wildfire Prediction Challenge where the goal is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting the burned area in different African regions, especially Zimbabwe, over the years 2014-2016​

. The model relies on historical climate data (such as temperature, rainfall, and land use) and geographical features to predict the extent of wildfires.
3. Approach and Solution Overview

This project has been structured into three main phases:

    Data Preprocessing:
        The raw data is first loaded and cleaned. Unnecessary columns such as unique identifiers (ID) and region names (ADM0_NAME) are dropped.
        Missing values are handled by either dropping incomplete rows or filling missing values based on the dataset’s characteristics.
        Features and target variables are identified for further processing.

    Feature Engineering:
        Scaling: All features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the input data. This ensures that no feature dominates due to its magnitude.
        Feature Expansion: Elevation data is expanded by adding non-linear transformations like squared and cubed terms of the elevation feature, which is important for capturing complex geographical variations.
        Dimensionality Reduction: To reduce data dimensionality and maintain essential features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied, reducing features to 10 principal components while retaining most of the variance in the data.

    Model Development and Evaluation:
        Several machine learning models are evaluated to determine the most suitable one for wildfire prediction:
            BaggingRegressor
            RandomForestRegressor
        Models are trained using the transformed dataset, and performance is evaluated using cross-validation with the KFold method to ensure model robustness.
        The primary evaluation metric is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which helps in understanding how far the predicted burned areas deviate from the actual values.
        The best model (in this case, RandomForestRegressor) is selected based on the average RMSE from the cross-validation results.

    Model Deployment:
        After determining the best-performing model, it is retrained on the entire training set and used to make predictions on the test data.
        The results (predicted burned areas) are saved to a submission file for evaluation against the true test data.

4. Solution Breakdown (Code Implementation)
4.1 Data Loading and Cleaning

The data is read using pandas. Unnecessary columns such as ID and ADM0_NAME are dropped to focus only on the relevant features.

python

data = pd.read_csv('~/data/train_data.csv')
columns_to_drop = ['ID', 'ADM0_NAME']
data = data.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)

Missing values are handled based on the nature of the dataset (e.g., imputed with the mean or dropped).
4.2 Feature Scaling and Engineering

The StandardScaler is used to normalize the features, which is critical for machine learning models that rely on distance metrics. Furthermore, feature expansion is carried out by adding squared and cubed terms of the elevation feature.

python

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

X_expanded = np.hstack([X_scaled, np.square(X_scaled[:, [X.columns.get_loc('Elevation')]]),
                        np.power(X_scaled[:, [X.columns.get_loc('Elevation')]], 3)])

4.3 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is applied to reduce the feature space to a manageable number (10 components), helping to eliminate noise and improve computational efficiency.

python

pca = PCA(n_components=10)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_expanded)

4.4 Model Training and Evaluation

The pipeline trains two ensemble models: BaggingRegressor and RandomForestRegressor. Each model is evaluated using K-fold cross-validation with 5 folds, and the RMSE for each fold is calculated. The model with the lowest RMSE is selected.

python

kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

for model_name, model in models.items():
    fold_rmse = []
    for train_index, val_index in kf.split(X_pca):
        X_train_fold, X_val_fold = X_pca[train_index], X_pca[val_index]
        y_train_fold, y_val_fold = y[train_index], y[val_index]
        rmse = evaluate_model(model, X_train_fold, X_val_fold, y_train_fold, y_val_fold)
        fold_rmse.append(rmse)
    print(f'{model_name} - Mean RMSE: {np.mean(fold_rmse)}')

4.5 Model Selection and Prediction

After training, the best model is selected and retrained on the entire dataset. The predictions on the test data are generated, and the submission file is created.

python

best_model = models['RandomForest']
best_model.fit(X_pca, y)

test_predictions = best_model.predict(test_data_pca)
submission = pd.DataFrame({'ID': test_data['ID'], 'target': test_predictions})
submission.to_csv('~/data/submission.csv', index=False)

5. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the ability to predict wildfire burned areas using historical climate and land use data. By applying feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble models such as RandomForestRegressor, the project achieves robust predictions, which are validated using cross-validation techniques.

Key outcomes:

    The pipeline efficiently handles preprocessing and model training using scalable methods.
    Feature engineering (expansion and PCA) improves the model’s ability to generalize to new data.
    The chosen model performs well in terms of prediction accuracy, as indicated by the RMSE metric.

6. Future Work
**
To further improve the model’s accuracy:**

    GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization can be applied to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model.
    Additional models, such as GradientBoostingRegressor or CatBoostRegressor, could be incorporated to explore ensemble model combinations.
    Incorporating time-series analysis for better temporal pattern recognition in wildfire occurrences could improve predictions.
